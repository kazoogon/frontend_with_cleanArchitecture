| components/ | Store presentation(view, UI) layer. Should be organize with atomic design for example, but later.                                                      |
| domain/     | Store domain layer. Entities and repository looks they should be in data directory, but in order to dependency inversion, they depends on domain layer |
| data/       | Store data layor (repository and data)                                                                                                                 |

## 🤔 What is clean architecture?
I'm not gonna here explain deeply, but as you can see clean architecture is similar to game structure

And this is famous architecture image, eyes automatically focus on big circle image, but right bottom image is also important

You can easily see architecture flow with that gaming image

### ⭐ About Presenter in frontend
It was difficult how to handle with **presenter** in frontend architecture, because frontend is UI itself

## 😎 Connection with SOLID principle
After enjoying Clean Architecture, I thought there are two important things in it.
```
1. separate of concerns
2. control dependency direction by using interface
```
Now let's think about number **2**  
If you have learned SOLID principle, would remind you of Dependency Inversion  
[I explained about Dependency Inversion with image](https://dev.to/kaziusan/solid-dependency-inversion-399h)

(Clean architecture and SOLID principle are written by same person, Robert C. Martin.)

## 🗒 TODO
- remove data button (local storage)

  easiest way to understand what is clean architecture if you understand Japanese

[react with clean architecture, github source code](https://github.com/falsy/react-with-clean-architecture)  
  I think this code is more real world code than mine, you even could get how to handle with web and mobile by using **adapter**
